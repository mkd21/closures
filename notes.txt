lets say there are many varibles inside the parent function but the clild function is using only 1 variable, then the closure will be formed with that 1 variable only and not will all the variables 

ex 

function parent()
{
    let a = 23;
    let b = 12;
    let c = 90;

    function child()    ---> will form closure with b variable only 
    {
        console.log(b);
    }

    return child;
}
